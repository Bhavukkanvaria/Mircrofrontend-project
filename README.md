# Microfrontends Implementation Showcase

A comprehensive demonstration of different Microfrontend architectures in React, showcasing various implementation approaches and state management strategies. This repository serves as a practical guide to understanding how microfrontends can be implemented in different scenarios.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

### 1. Enterprise Dashboard (NPM Workspaces)
An enterprise-grade implementation using NPM workspaces and Module Federation, demonstrating:
- Workspace-based architecture
- Multiple microfrontends (Host, Auth, Analytics)
- Shared component library
- Parallel execution using concurrent mode

[View Enterprise Dashboard Project](./enterprise-dashboard2)

### 2. React Microfrontends
A pure React implementation showing:
- Basic Module Federation setup
- Three applications:
  - Host application
  - Shared components
  - TodoList feature
- Runtime integration of independently deployable applications

### 3. Redux Microfrontends
Advanced implementation incorporating Redux for state management:
- Centralized state management across microfrontends
- Host and Shared applications
- Integration of Redux store across different applications
- State sharing between microfrontends
